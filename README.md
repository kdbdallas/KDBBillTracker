This is a simple bill(s) tracking app for iOS built using SwiftUI and utilizing SwiftData and Swift 6 Conncurrency.

This app will allow you to add bills with imformation such as the name, amount, repeat interval, etc.
From there your bills will show as an idicator of their due date on the calendar and a list below of upcoming bills.

You then will get notified when a bill's due date is coming up.
Once a bill is paid either automatically or manually, you have the ability to mark the bill as paid and if the bill repeats it will get it ready for the next due date.

Other features will be included, however this is the basics of the app.
